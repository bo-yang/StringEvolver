StringEvolver
=============

This is a demo program of Genetic Algorithm.

A string evolver is an evolutionary algorithm that tries to match a reference string from a population of random strings. The underlying character set of the string evolver is the alphabet from which the strings are drawn.

For more details of this demo, please refer to my article: http://bo-yang.github.io/2012/05/04/string-evolver/.
